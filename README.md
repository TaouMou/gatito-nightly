# Gatito Nightly

Fork of the theme "Gatito Theme" but with darker background color and more use of the accent color.

I am a big fan of Nord, so there is also an added theme with similar UI colors, but with Nord syntax highlighting and accent, called `Gatitio Nightly Blue`.

To install this theme:
  1.  Open Extensions on the sidebar.
  2.  Search for Gatito Theme.
  3.  Install & reload.
  4.  ⌘ + ⇧ + P and type "Color Theme".
  5.  Pick `Gatito Nightly` or `Gatito Nightly Blue` from the list and hit enter.
  6.  Done.

**Enjoy!**
